 <p>Workpads must meet the highest performance and security standards in all possible categories, including on-device, over networks, over-the-air and storage. Testing standard workpads applications and community-created programs is the ongoing purpose and passion of the project. </p>
 <p>We actively use GitHub Projects to suggest tests and log results. View all related projects <a href="https://github.com/orgs/babbworks/projects?query=is%3Aopen+workpads">here</a> or select a topic.</p>
